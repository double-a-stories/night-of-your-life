With a colorful wipe transition, the stream opens to the bedroom-slash-dungeon-slash-studio of Selkie Exotix, professional pred streamer.

Her desktop has a mic, a keyboard, and a dildo which is probably bigger than both your arms.

Her bedroom is pink and frilly, save for various implements of sexual restraint. Various silicone toys and leather straps decorate the walls, between some redbubble posters. A bookshelf of eight or nine skulls is marked the "Hall of Fame" with glittery marker. One more skull sits on her desk.


* [[Selkie: Enter.]]

:: Selkie: Enter. [stream]

<!-- Idea: Get Jack to draw a hippo girl in her stream setup, waving at chat. And also a PFP for her and Aster. -->

From the right of the frame, a hippo woman enters and plops down in her gaming chair. She's wearing purple gym shorts and a tank-top, leaving her huge, squishy stomach exposed and conspicuously in frame.

She beams at the chat, speaking with a sultry voice, 
<span.q-selkie>Hi cuties, it's Selkie! Welcome to this week's stream! I hope you're all ready for a rousing evening.</span>

<span.q-selkie>Ooh, we're starting off strong tonight! Thanks for the twenty, Risky! Always nice to have you in the chat.</span>

Selkie blows a little kiss at the camera, and gropes her gut.

* [[First, some housekeeping.]]

:: First, some housekeeping. [stream]

<span.q-selkie>I see a lot of repeat customers in chat, but for any first-time viewers, a little housekeeping:</span>

She gets in close to the camera.

<span.q-selkie>I'm SelkieSwallows. This is a **kill** show. Please enjoy yourselves in chat, but keep the drama to a minimum. Do not record this stream!</span>

<span.q-selkie>Donations are highly encouraged! They help the beautiful woman before you afford food and rent. If we hit the $1200 donation goal tonight, you'll all get to enjoy watching my prey churn.</span>

She clears her throat.

<span.q-selkie>Final warning: ***This is a kill show***. Everything you are about to see is completely consensual. If you're an anti-acid or a PRA, this is your warning to leave now, and take your complaints to another website. Thanks.</span>

* [[Show off skull.]]

:: Show off skull. [stream]
With a smirk, She lifts a polished white skull of her desk.

<span.q-selkie>As always, we'll start the night off by bidding a heartful farewell to last week's guest.</span> The hippo brandishes the skull to the camera. You recognize it as a whitetail deer, mostly because you watched one die last week.

<span.q-selkie>You regulars will surely remember Lucy, a.k.a, scrumplyDelucious, our sweet little deer girl, a long time platinum subscriber to the channel..

<span.q-selkie>Yes, Lucy was a dedicated student, a loving girlfriend, and a platinum subscriber to the channel. And now, she's just more hippo pudge! Her scrumptious little squeaks will be sorely missed, but she's in a much better place now.</span> She smirks and wiggles her gut.

Selkie places the skull inside a small cardboard box.

<span.q-selkie>Oh, thanks for the fifty, GT!

Hlaaaaaaaah!</span> She opens wide and flashes her uvula.

She happily rubs and bounces her tummy. It lets out a gurgle into the desk mic positioned specifically to capture them. <span.q-selkie>Fufufu. Getting pretty hungry too...</span>
