* [[Stream: Start.]]

:: Stream: Start. [stream]

With a colorful wipe transition, the stream opens to the studio of Selkie Exotix, professional pred streamer.

Her studio (slash dungeon, slash bedroom) is pink and frilly, save for various implements of sexual restraint. Silicone toys and leather straps adorn the walls, between some redbubble posters. A bookshelf of eight or nine skulls is marked the "Hall of Fame" with glittery marker.

Her desktop has a microphone, a glowing purple RGB keyboard, and a bright pink dragon dildo which is probably bigger than both your arms.

One more skull sits on her desk, just slightly out of frame.

* [[Selkie: Enter.]]

:: Selkie: Enter. [stream]

<!-- Idea: Get Jack to draw a hippo girl in her stream setup, waving at chat. And also a PFP for her and Aster. -->

From the right of the frame, a hippopotamus enters and plops down in her gaming chair. She's wearing purple gym shorts and a tank-top, leaving her huge, squishy stomach exposed and conspicuously in frame.

She beams at the chat, licks her lips, and says with a low, sultry voice, 
<span.q-selkie>Hello lovelies, it's Selkie. Thanks for joining me on tonight's stream. I hope you're all ready for a rousing evening.</span>

Selkie blows a little kiss at the camera, and gropes her gut.
<span.q-selkie>Ooh, we're starting off strong tonight! Thanks for the tips, Risky! Always nice to have you in the chat.</span>


* [[Selkie: A little housekeeping.]]

:: Selkie: A little housekeeping. [stream]

<span.q-selkie>I see a lot of repeat customers in chat, but for any first-time viewers, a little housekeeping:</span>

She gets in close to the camera.

<span.q-selkie>I'm SelkieSwallows. Please enjoy yourselves in chat, but keep the drama to a minimum. Do not record this stream!</span>

<span.q-selkie>Tips are highly encouraged! If we hit the $1200 goal tonight, you'll all get to enjoy watching my prey churn.</span>

She clears her throat.

<span.q-selkie>Final warning: ***This is a kill show***. Everything you are about to see is legal and consensual. If you're an anti-acid or a PRA, this is your warning to leave now, and take your complaints to another website.</span>

With a smirk, She lifts a polished white skull of her desk.

<span.q-selkie>As always, we'll start the night off by bidding a heartful farewell to last week's guest.</span> The hippo brandishes the skull to the camera. You recognize it as belonging to a whitetail deer, mostly because you watched her be digested on stream last week.

* [[Show off skull.]]

<span.q-selkie>Yes, Lucy was a dedicated student, a loving girlfriend, and a platinum subscriber to the channel. And now, she's just more hippo pudge! Her scrumptious little squeaks will be sorely missed, but she's in a much better place now.</span> She smirks and wiggles her gut.
