:: Chapter 5

Wednesday. You are in a stall at the flea market selling off all your shit. Honestly you're sort of just giving it away, but you'll take money, you guess.

Not sure what you'll do with the rest of it. Guess you'll give it to Selkie? She could probably use it. Or charity or something.

Selling:
* Bed.
* TV.
* Computer.
* Toaster.

IDEA: Someone buys you?
